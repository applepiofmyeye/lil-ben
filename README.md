# Lil Ben Universe E-Commerce Website
Made for my own little shop, I made this with the following techstack:
- Node.js (Express) Server + Stripe: for an API endpoint for my React App to call on
- Frontend: React
- Backend: (*hardcoded yikes*) It was meant to be a project to learn how to use Stripe, so my backend (3 products and their information) were all put into a simple JSON.

currently it is not maintained, an API key seems to have expired, I will come back to fix this one day and sell lil bens again <3
